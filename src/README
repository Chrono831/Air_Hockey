The class structure I'm working with right now is

GameObject -> GameBox -- initialize as 'screen', 'table', 'board', etc
	   -> GameCircle -- init as 'puck' paddle'
(GameCircle not yet started)

Notes:
 - Makefile : really doesn't do anything useful right now; I made a quick script
    file to run in it's place; nothing beautiful, but it works; just edit and add
    to that as needed until we figure out the best thing to do with the Makefile
 - compile.sh : above mentioned script, use the template commands in here if you
    need to make anything else compile.
 - Compiling from that script the only warnings I get are the "warning: unused 
    parameter 'blah'" warnings; no problem
 - None of these files are perfect, there is still a lot of documentation, tweaking,
    and complete re-writing needed for many functions; I wanted to get something
    started that could be worked off of and I think I've achieved that.
